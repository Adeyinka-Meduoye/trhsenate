#TRH Senate Council – Description

The TRH Senate Council is the central decision-making and coordinating body within TRH. It serves as a structured forum where key matters are discussed, reviewed, and resolved for the overall growth, order, and effectiveness of the organization.

The council is made up of designated members who hold defined roles and responsibilities. Its purpose is to ensure transparency, accountability, and collective leadership rather than individual control. Through scheduled meetings and documented resolutions, the council provides direction, maintains standards, and oversees important initiatives.

The TRH Senate Council operates on principles of collaboration, fairness, and clarity. Discussions are guided by agreed procedures, and outcomes are recorded to maintain continuity and institutional memory.

In essence, the council functions as the organizational backbone of TRH — aligning members, structuring decisions, and providing a reliable system for governance and coordination.
